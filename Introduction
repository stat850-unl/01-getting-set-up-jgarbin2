Hello Everybody!

My name is Jonah Garbin and I'm a second year Ph.D Student in the Qualitative,
Quantitative, Psychometrics Program in Educational Psychology.  My interests
include statistics, my family, my girlfriend (Sadie), my dog Ernie, Soccer,
and critical thinking topics (doesn't matter the topic, as long as it requires
us to think critically with the goal of solving a problem).  My hobbies include 
Statistics, Soccer, hanging out with friends, and video games.

In regards to my computing experience, I don't have a whole bunch, hence the
reason for me attending this class.  I am very familiar with syntax, and
overall mechanics of SPSS.  However, I have limited experience working with R
and SAS.  I understand that there will be a point that working with SPSS won't
be feasible, so I know it's important to learn how to code in R and be able 
to be adequate with it.

I'm really excited for this course.  I hope I learn a lot of applicable and
useful things!

Jonah
